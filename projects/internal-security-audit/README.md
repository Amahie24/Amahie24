# 🛡️ Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys

## Objective

This project simulated a professional internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a fictional company facing cybersecurity risks as it expands its online presence. The audit focused on identifying existing assets, evaluating security controls, and checking compliance using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. The goal was to assess risks and suggest improvements to enhance the organization’s security posture and business continuity.
