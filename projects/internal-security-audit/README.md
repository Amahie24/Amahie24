# 🛡️ Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys

## Objective

This project simulated a professional internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a fictional company facing new cybersecurity challenges as it expands online. The audit focused on identifying existing assets, reviewing control implementation, and checking for compliance with standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC Type 1/2 using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.

The goal was to assess risks and suggest security improvements to support the organization’s business continuity and regulatory compliance.

---

### Step 2: Risk Analysis
Analyzed risks such as open access to customer data, lack of encryption, weak password policy, no disaster recovery plan, and missing IDS system.

🟡 **Risk Score: 8/10**  
💡 **Impact:** High likelihood of data loss, regulatory fines, or business disruption.

### Step 3: Control Assessment
Used the provided checklist to assess whether each security control was implemented, from firewalls and antivirus software to physical controls like locks and CCTV.

### Step 4: Compliance Evaluation
Reviewed alignment with:
- **PCI DSS** (credit card protection)
- **GDPR** (EU data protection)
- **SOC** (data integrity and access policies)

Flagged gaps like lack of encryption, no access restrictions, and missing privacy procedures.

---

### Step 5: Recommendations (Summary)
- Implement **least privilege access** and **separation of duties**
- Upgrade password policies and enforce with centralized management
- Introduce **encryption for stored and transmitted credit card data**
- Deploy an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
- Establish a **disaster recovery plan** with regular backups
- Enforce **EU breach notification policies** and improve documentation

## ✅ Outcome

- Achieved a passing score of **80%+**
- Gained practical experience conducting internal audits
- Demonstrated ability to assess controls and provide professional, standards-based recommendations
- Learned how to document and present cybersecurity findings clearly
