🧱 ICMP Flood DDoS Incident Report
Course-Based Simulation

Investigated and documented a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that disrupted internal network access through a flood of ICMP packets. Analyzed root causes, containment, and long-term mitigation measures using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

📖 Scenario
The company’s internal network became unresponsive for two hours due to a sudden flood of ICMP echo requests (pings). Critical network services went offline, halting internal operations. The cybersecurity team traced the attack to a misconfigured firewall that allowed unfiltered ICMP traffic from external sources.

🔎 Key Analysis Findings
Attack type: ICMP flood (DDoS)

Impact: Entire internal network was taken offline

Root cause: Unconfigured firewall allowed unauthorized ICMP traffic

Resolution actions:

Blocked incoming ICMP packets at the firewall

Disabled non-critical services to stabilize network load

Restored critical services to resume business operations

Evidence: Firewall logs, ICMP traffic volume spikes, service response failures

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
✅ Applied NIST CSF to organize incident response and recovery
✅ Identified DDoS symptoms and ICMP flood behavior
✅ Recommended and implemented firewall rule changes
✅ Strengthened detection and prevention through IDPS and monitoring
✅ Documented a real-world incident using professional frameworks
