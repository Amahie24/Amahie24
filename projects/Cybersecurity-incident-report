# 🛰️ DNS Traffic Analysis Incident Report
**Course-Based Simulation**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

In this activity, I analyzed DNS and ICMP traffic in transit using data captured from a network protocol analyzer tool. The goal was to identify the network protocol affected during the cybersecurity incident and document findings in a professional report.

Knowing how to identify potentially malicious or problematic traffic on a network helps cybersecurity analysts assess security risks and reinforce network security.

## 📝 Scenario

As a cybersecurity analyst at a company specializing in IT services, I was tasked with investigating a critical issue: several customers reported they couldn’t access the client’s website, **www.yummyrecipesforme.com**, receiving the error **“destination port unreachable.”**

I replicated the issue and launched `tcpdump` to analyze the traffic. The browser’s query to the DNS server was sent over **UDP port 53**, but the network analyzer revealed repeated **ICMP packets containing the error message: `udp port 53 unreachable`.**

Key points from the tcpdump log analysis:

- **Initial request:** UDP packets were sent from the client’s IP to the DNS server’s IP on port 53 to resolve the domain name.
- **Error response:** ICMP error messages were received stating **“udp port 53 unreachable”**, indicating the DNS server was down or blocked.
- **Timestamps:** The incident occurred at approximately **1:24 p.m.** (as shown in the logs, e.g., `13:24:32.192571`).
- **IP details:** The logs included clear source and destination IP addresses:
  - Client IP: `192.51.100.15`
  - DNS Server IP: `203.0.113.2`

The repeated ICMP error messages confirmed the DNS service was unavailable or blocked, most likely due to a misconfiguration or a DoS attack.

## 🔎 Analysis Summary

- **Network protocol affected:** UDP traffic on port 53, which is critical for DNS resolution.
- **Service impacted:** DNS — preventing clients from resolving domain names.
- **Likely cause:** The DNS server was either down, overwhelmed by a Denial of Service attack, or blocked by a firewall misconfiguration.
